# Counter-App

This App contains three buttons that allows you to itirate over numbers using the decrease,increase or reset button.

# How it works

- Locate the increase button when you want to itirate over positive integers. When this is correctly done, It automatically displays a green number.

- Locate the decrease button when you want to move sequentially over negative integers. If correctly done, It will display red count.

- Lastly you can refresh by using the reset button
